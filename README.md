Simple Css Resets For Browser Consistency

# CSS Reset

## Overview
This CSS reset helps ensure a consistent baseline for styling across different browsers. It removes default styling for common HTML elements, ensuring that your custom styles are applied uniformly. This reset is comprehensive and includes modern HTML5 elements, form elements, and various media elements.

## Why Use a CSS Reset?
Different browsers have their own default styles for HTML elements, which can lead to inconsistencies in how your website appears across different browsers. A CSS reset mitigates these differences by removing default margins, padding, borders, and other styling from all elements, allowing you to start with a clean slate.

## Usage
To use this CSS reset, simply copy the CSS code into your project's main CSS file or include it as a separate CSS file in your HTML.

### Example
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Project</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/your/css/reset.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/your/main.css">
</head>
<body>
